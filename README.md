<h2>BUSS APP</h2>
<p>
My project is a bus ticket booking application. When the application is opened, a login screen appears and the user needs to sign in. If the user does not have an account, they can click on 'register' to create a user account and then log in. After logging in, the main page opens where the user can select their current city, destination city, and travel date.
</p>
<p>
After this selection, a page with bus information is displayed where users can choose their seats. By clicking the 'pay' button, users are directed to the payment page where the payment transaction is completed.
</p>


<h2>USAGE</h2>
<h3>Emulator Setup</h3>
For development and testing, I primarily use the Android Studio emulator. However, it's also possible to test the application on your personal device.

<h3>Testing on a Personal Device</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Make sure you have the necessary drivers installed if you're using a physical Android device.
  </li>
  <li>
Enable 'USB Debugging' on your device.
  </li>
  <li>
Connect your device to the computer.
  </li>
  <li>
Your device should now be detectable by Android Studio or any other development environment you're using.    
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Publishing</h3>
<p>For publishing and distribution, I use Expo. Follow the official Expo documentation for detailed steps on how to publish your application.</p>

<p>1. Fork the repo and then clone it or download it.</p>
<p>2.First install all dependencies:</p>
<div>
  <storng>npm install</storng> (with npm) </br>
  <storng>yarn</storng> (or with yarn)
  <storng></storng> (or with yarn)
</div> </br>

3. Fork the backend by reading the README file.
</a>
</p>
<p>
4. Start the server
</p>
<div>
